N  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the Reset and clock control (RCC) peripheral:           
N  *           - Internal/external clocks, PLL, CSS and MCO configuration
N  *           - System, AHB and APB busses clocks configuration
N  *           - Peripheral clocks configuration
N  *           - Interrupts and flags management
N  *

N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                               RCC specific features
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *    
N  *          After reset the device is running from Internal High Speed oscillator 
N  *          (HSI 16MHz) with Flash 0 wait state, Flash prefetch buffer, D-Cache 
N  *          and I-Cache are disabled, and all peripherals are off except internal
N  *          SRAM, Flash and JTAG.
N  *           - There is no prescaler on High speed (AHB) and Low speed (APB) busses;
N  *             all peripherals mapped on these busses are running at HSI speed.
N  *       	  - The clock for all peripherals is switched off, except the SRAM and FLASH.
N  *           - All GPIOs are in input floating state, except the JTAG pins which
N  *             are assigned to be used for debug purpose.
N  *        
N  *          Once the device started from reset, the user application has to:        
N  *           - Configure the clock source to be used to drive the System clock
N  *             (if the application needs higher frequency/performance)
N  *           - Configure the System clock frequency and Flash settings  
N  *           - Configure the AHB and APB busses prescalers
N  *           - Enable the clock for the peripheral(s) to be used
N  *           - Configure the clock source(s) for peripherals which clocks are not
N  *             derived from the System clock (I2S, RTC, ADC, USB OTG FS/SDIO/RNG)      
N  *
