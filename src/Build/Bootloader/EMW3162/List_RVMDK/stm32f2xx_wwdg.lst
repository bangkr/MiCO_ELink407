N  * @date    05-March-2012 
N  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the Window watchdog (WWDG) peripheral:           
N  *           - Prescaler, Refresh window and Counter configuration
N  *           - WWDG activation
N  *           - Interrupts and flags management
N  *             
N  *  @verbatim

N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                                     WWDG features
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                                        
N  *          Once enabled the WWDG generates a system reset on expiry of a programmed
N  *          time period, unless the program refreshes the counter (downcounter) 
N  *          before to reach 0x3F value (i.e. a reset is generated when the counter
N  *          value rolls over from 0x40 to 0x3F). 
N  *          An MCU reset is also generated if the counter value is refreshed
N  *          before the counter has reached the refresh window value. This 
N  *          implies that the counter must be refreshed in a limited window.
N  *            
N  *          Once enabled the WWDG cannot be disabled except by a system reset.                          
N  *          
N  *          WWDGRST flag in RCC_CSR register can be used to inform when a WWDG
N  *          reset occurs.
N  *            
N  *          The WWDG counter input clock is derived from the APB clock divided 
N  *          by a programmable prescaler.
N  *              
N  *          WWDG counter clock = PCLK1 / Prescaler
N  *          WWDG timeout = (WWDG counter clock) * (counter value)
N  *                      
N  *          Min-max timeout value @30 MHz(PCLK1): ~136.5 us / ~69.9 ms
N  *                            
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                                 How to use this driver
N  *          =================================================================== 
N  *          1. Enable WWDG clock using RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB1Periph_WWDG, ENABLE) function
N  *            
N  *          2. Configure the WWDG prescaler using WWDG_SetPrescaler() function
N  *                           
N  *          3. Configure the WWDG refresh window using WWDG_SetWindowValue() function
N  *            
N  *          4. Set the WWDG counter value and start it using WWDG_Enable() function.
N  *             When the WWDG is enabled the counter value should be configured to 
N  *             a value greater than 0x40 to prevent generating an immediate reset.     
N  *            
N  *          5. Optionally you can enable the Early wakeup interrupt which is 
N  *             generated when the counter reach 0x40.
N  *             Once enabled this interrupt cannot be disabled except by a system reset.
N  *                 
N  *          6. Then the application program must refresh the WWDG counter at regular
N  *             intervals during normal operation to prevent an MCU reset, using
N  *             WWDG_SetCounter() function. This operation must occur only when
N  *             the counter value is lower than the refresh window value, 
N  *             programmed using WWDG_SetWindowValue().         
N  *
