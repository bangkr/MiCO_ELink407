N  * @brief   This file provides firmware functions to manage the following 
N  *          functionalities of the Independent watchdog (IWDG) peripheral:           
N  *           - Prescaler and Counter configuration
N  *           - IWDG activation
N  *           - Flag management

N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                                     IWDG features
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *    
N  *          The IWDG can be started by either software or hardware (configurable
N  *          through option byte).
N  *            
N  *          The IWDG is clocked by its own dedicated low-speed clock (LSI) and
N  *          thus stays active even if the main clock fails.
N  *          Once the IWDG is started, the LSI is forced ON and cannot be disabled
N  *          (LSI cannot be disabled too), and the counter starts counting down from 
N  *          the reset value of 0xFFF. When it reaches the end of count value (0x000)
N  *          a system reset is generated.
N  *          The IWDG counter should be reloaded at regular intervals to prevent
N  *          an MCU reset.
N  *                           
N  *          The IWDG is implemented in the VDD voltage domain that is still functional
N  *          in STOP and STANDBY mode (IWDG reset can wake-up from STANDBY).          
N  *            
N  *          IWDGRST flag in RCC_CSR register can be used to inform when a IWDG
N  *          reset occurs.
N  *            
N  *          Min-max timeout value @32KHz (LSI): ~125us / ~32.7s
N  *          The IWDG timeout may vary due to LSI frequency dispersion. STM32F2xx
N  *          devices provide the capability to measure the LSI frequency (LSI clock
N  *          connected internally to TIM5 CH4 input capture). The measured value
N  *          can be used to have an IWDG timeout with an acceptable accuracy. 
N  *          For more information, please refer to the STM32F2xx Reference manual
N  *          
N  *                            
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *                                 How to use this driver
N  *          ===================================================================
N  *          1. Enable write access to IWDG_PR and IWDG_RLR registers using
N  *             IWDG_WriteAccessCmd(IWDG_WriteAccess_Enable) function
N  *               
N  *          2. Configure the IWDG prescaler using IWDG_SetPrescaler() function
N  *            
N  *          3. Configure the IWDG counter value using IWDG_SetReload() function.
N  *             This value will be loaded in the IWDG counter each time the counter
N  *             is reloaded, then the IWDG will start counting down from this value.
N  *            
N  *          4. Start the IWDG using IWDG_Enable() function, when the IWDG is used
N  *             in software mode (no need to enable the LSI, it will be enabled
N  *             by hardware)
N  *             
N  *          5. Then the application program must reload the IWDG counter at regular
N  *             intervals during normal operation to prevent an MCU reset, using
N  *             IWDG_ReloadCounter() function.      
N  *
